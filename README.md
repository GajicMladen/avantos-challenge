# Avantos Challenge - React Application

A React application for visualizing and managing form field mappings through an interactive graph interface.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)

### 1. Start the Backend Simulator

**IMPORTANT**: Start the backend server first before running the React application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mosaic-avantos/frontendchallengeserver.git
cd frontendchallengeserver
npm install
npm start
```

The backend server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Start the React Application

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd challenge-react-app
npm install
npm start
```

The React app runs on `http://localhost:3001` and opens automatically in your browser.

### üîß Port Configuration

The React app is configured to run on port **3001** by default. If you need a different port:

```bash
npm run start:3000  # Port 3000
npm run start:3002  # Port 3002
PORT=3003 npm start  # Custom port
```

## üìã Available Scripts

### React App (challenge-react-app)
- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode (port 3001)
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production

## üéØ What This App Does

This application visualizes form field mappings through an interactive graph:

1. **View Form Dependencies**: Interactive graph showing relationships between forms
2. **Map Form Fields**: Click nodes to map form fields to data sources
3. **Manage Mappings**: Add, remove, and modify field mappings
4. **Real-time Updates**: See changes reflected immediately in the graph

## üîß Technology Stack

- **React 18.3.1** with TypeScript
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Flow** for graph visualization
- **PrimeReact** for UI components
- **RTK Query** for API integration

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Graph Not Loading**
   - Ensure backend server is running on port 3001
   - Check browser console for API errors

2. **Port Conflicts**
   - If port 3001 is in use, try `npm run start:3002`
   - Check what's running: `lsof -i :3001`

3. **Tests Failing**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript compilation errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always start the backend simulator (`frontendchallengeserver`) before running the React application (`challenge-react-app`).
